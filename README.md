## General Information
Both members of our team have experienced a lot of mansplaining from tech bros. We're smart, we're driven, and we learn fast, but after one or two tech mansplanations, you stop asking questions for fear of being treated like an idiot.

Tech blogs don't help, because using tech jargon to explain more tech jargon is part of the gatekeeping culture that scares so many people away from exploring the tech world. So, what if there was a resource that explains tech concepts, in plain language, so you can keep up with tech bros without relying on their "let me teach you" responses to simple questions? 
 
Enter tweetsplain. It's a website, with tech definitions, in plain language: tweets. If you want to learn more, you can click on each term to watch a youtube video of someone who is NOT a tech bro explaining the term more.
